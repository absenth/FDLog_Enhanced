GITHUB README: 

	This program is 33 years old!! And it keeps on going..

	Alan K Biocca W6AKB (Formerly WB6ZQZ) Wrote this in 1984 using small c 
	and it was titled "WB6ZQZ's Field Day Logging Program". In 2002, Mr Biocca 
	rewrote the program in Python and renamed it FDLog. That year, FDLog was 
	released as open source with the GNU License. FDLog is still in use by the High Sierra 
	Field Day Group and maintained by Mr Biocca at www.fdlog.info. 

	My name is Scott Hibbs KD4SIR. I found FDLog on the internet and started using it
	for Field Day 2012. I immediately started learning Python. After using FDLog for 
	Field Day 2013, the South Central Indiana Communications Support Group 
	(SCICSG - we pronounce it scuzzy) wanted to know their individual scores and 
	wanted a quick way to see who was on what bands. When our upgrades were not 
	acted on, we decided to modify the program for ourselves for 2014. We have enhanced 
	the original program and occasionally will pick up some of Mr Biocca's new ideas too.  

	We hope you fall in love with the program (like we have) and can help us improve it. 
	Send suggestions, help, pull request, ideas to Scott Hibbs at gmail.com
	
	Please look in the Releaselog file to see a list of our Enhancements!

ITEMS WE ARE WORKING ON NEXT:

	Future Enhancements:
		* Add more scoring: 
			complex gota points, youth, information table, official visitors, 
			max 20 radios, power multipliers, educational activity... 
		* An Information Table node that will allow sign ins, show our group score, 
			the top 5 operators, the top 5 visitors, Worked All States etc.
		* Phonetics at the bottom of the screen for our call exchange (gota too)
		* Be nice if the entry is rejected for non-dupes (bad section etc) that the 
			up arrow will repopulate the entry. 
	Future Fixes: 
		# Dupe check for requested fills - 2 UNconnected nodes can dupe and both count
				when connected. (currently dupe checking is at entry - not on fills)
