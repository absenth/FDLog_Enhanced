SCICSG-FDLog

2015_beta-3
	This is actually stable but it isn't 100% working. Now we 
	make the program work and start upgrading it.  

2015_beta-2 
	More code intigration from the original fdlog. This one
	from the beta 152i. We need to work on getting this stable. 

2015_beta_1
	Combined our stable version with the latest beta from 1-152-n.
	This includes the sql database and the fixed time function. 
	We need to get this stable and working with my enhancements.

2015_Field Day Stable 
	Code cleanup from fdlog 1-149-02
	
	


The following is the release log of the original fdlog:

1-149-02 2011/7/11 bug fix

    allow lowercase contest names
    add 900 mhz to editing validation
    note that report requires 4 chars in editor to save
    editor shows unvalidated fields in yellow after save attempt
    edit dialog box disappears on successful save, else stays with yellow
    fields that need fixing.
    
1-149 2011/07/02 contest set version

    adding .set contst menu for (FD,VHF)
        set global to contest type .set contst FD|VHF
        adjust dup check to call for FD, and include /<grid> for VHF
    adjust bands for VHF, include 900, (drop below 6m?)
        dropping bands is tricky, leave for later.
        did add 900 band however

    setup for mercurial, opened Google Code project

1-148vf 2011/06/25 fd version

    commented out VHF code but kept other changes for 2011 fday

1-148v 2010/08/18 vhf version

    dup checking includes call/grid
    call column widened by 1 char to handle additional width
    still need to enter something in the report, such as signal strength
    fixed some small bugs in log color and editing due to dependence
    on data in the scrollbox. May be only one line change to
    make compatible with standard Field Day.

    q just needs call/grid & band (use same mode for all Qs)
    got it to work.
    added a column to make call/grid fit
    fixed a few bugs
    newline on log missing, added it, later removed again

    now two bugs. (fixed)
    local log color=blue not working
    - always black
    edit left mouse click for edit on log not working
    - probably getting error at some point and killing that thread/window
    - problem was two functions that pick up chars from msg buffer
    - adjust them by 1 char, worked

    note that python is complaining about md5 and using hashlib instead.
    snap 9, release 3 at this point

    also after space input didn't echo call with full grid. Fixed.
    converted from md5 library to hashlib. done.
    snap 10 release 4

    made call box in edit dig wider to accommodate 11 char call/grid
    added code to disallow editing another node's Qs
    after changing node id and restarting the q's still came up blue? bug?
    test code was still in. fixed.
    snap 11

    comment cleanup. added more notes detail.


1.147 2009/06/20 pre fd (used on FD 2009,2010)

    changed GOTA Q limit from 400 to 500
    demo modes commented out
    80 meter cw frequency for w1aw changed (w1aw.txt)

    qrp 5W from mains or generator has a multiplier 2 - same as 150W.
        This is not scored properly by the program yet.
    max of 20 transmitters is not enforced by the program
    educational activity is not scored by the program.
    complex GOTA bonus points are not handled by the program

1.146B has GOTA call fixed. 6/15/2008 AKB
        gcall will accept a proper call with number, somewhere prior to this
        the number part of the regex got lost. This affects log output.

1.1  2002/03/18 23:35:15  akbiocca
     Initial revision (to CVS)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Program History (Pre-CVS)

Re-coding started 3/6/2002 Alan K Biocca WB6ZQZ (wb6zqz@arrl.net)
Design based on fdlog.c, by same author starting in 1984 for CP/M.

Goal: a minimum keystroke field day logging program supporting
      a group of users (a whole FD site) simultaneously

The original program was multitasking and supported multiple
stations on serial terminals, 2000 lines of small C and asm.
With help from Eric Williams WD6CMU and Steve Wilson KA6S, it
devolved to MSDOS but there supported only one user, so the
database had to be manually collated to include all stations.

Plan: use networking, usually 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless,
   to interconnect the stations. use a flood/fill algorithm
   to share data. avoid single point failure, stations can join
   and depart the network with minimal effect.

v0.01 started 3/2002. chose python as it has the features
   to do this project well and efficiently
   after 2.5 days of effort the program is working for a
   single station. useful for single station logging
-------------------------------------------------------------------
